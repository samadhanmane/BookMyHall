Only if you have nodejs and other related files this will run 
I have used tailwind css using react and also used react router-dom and java script xml as well


---------------Frontend part---------------
1)To start frontend go to frontend directory:

cd frontend 

2)and then run:

npm run dev 

3)After click on localhost link:
It will be looking like this

Local:   http://localhost:5173/


---------Backend part------------
To start backend go to backend directory:
cd backend 

and then run:
npm start server 

If you are getting 

Server Started 4000
Database Connected

then backend is running successfully
